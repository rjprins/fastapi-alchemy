### Improved
- **Schema Generation**: Enhanced `create_model_with_optional_fields` function to use the same robust inheritance handling as `create_model_without_read_only_fields`. This ensures better consistency between creation and update schemas and improves handling of complex inheritance hierarchies.

### Fixed
- **Dependencies**: Added `aiosqlite` as a development dependency for testing purposes.

### Technical Details
- Update schemas now properly remove read-only fields entirely (instead of making them optional)
- All writable fields in update schemas use `NOT_SET` defaults for proper partial update behavior
- Improved base class handling for complex inheritance scenarios
- Better preservation of validators, configuration, and metadata
